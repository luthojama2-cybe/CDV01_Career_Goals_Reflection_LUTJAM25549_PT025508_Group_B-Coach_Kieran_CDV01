### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    
    - List your specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals.
    Complete my software development bootcamp
    Resign from my bar-tending job
    Begin and internship at a tech company (Start small
    )
    - Explain the rationale behind each goal.
    Completing bootcamp - I've always wanted to break into the world of tech, but life always seemed to get in the way. I have a feeling that it's because I relied on other people to tell me how to  make it happen,but now that I have taken control of my life, I'm not relying on anyone to carry me through this camp but myself and I have faith in myself, if that count for anything.

    My current job - Honestly, I prefer a 9-5, doing what I love, than working long hours at the bar having to constantly put on a smile for tips.

    Internship - Breaking into the tech world specially now is not easy, regardless of the qualifications you have, for that reason, the goal is to first get my foot in the door and taking on even the smallest challenges until my experience and work speaks for itself. That being said, if a big opportunity presents itself, I'm taking it.

2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
    - Outline your long-term career aspirations.
    Become a senior tech developer
    Work for a notable tech company

    - Describe how these align with your interests and skills.
    Becoming a master - As I've said before, I plan to become a development (css) master and becoming a senior dev, will cement that goal because I will be at the top of the developer chain.

    Tech company employment - I would like to work for a company that constantly challenges me to be better and a company that carries a lot of weight will do that and also build on my first goal of becoming a master.

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    
    - Detail specific actions or steps needed to achieve each short-term goal.
    Practise everyday
    Constantly educate myself on new concepts used today
    Submit assignments on time.
    Commit myself to my job regardless of how I feel about it.

    - Include any resources or support required.
    AI (Artificial Intelligence)
    The internet
    Developers that occupy a seat in the industry.

2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
    - Describe the preparations or groundwork necessary for your long-term aspirations.
    Dedication - To sacrifice my time and body towards my goals.
    Hard work - To work on becoming better each day through consistent practise, challenges and out sourcing.
    Patience - Realising that to get where I need to be, it won't be a walk in the park but consistent effort and application of the first 2  steps.

    - Consider additional skills, experiences, or qualifications needed.
    Learn other programming languages, specifically Java.
    Learn prompt enginnering as we are moving into the world of AI each day, so developers have to adapt.

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
    - Identify potential obstacles or challenges in reaching your goals.
    Time - Managing my time between my job, the bootcamp, assignments and code practise.
    Information gathering - Currently there are too many concepts to learn, tools to use, I have to narrow down the fundamental ones needed to contribute to my goal.

    - Consider strategies to overcome these challenges.
    Time - I have to be very strict with how I use my time, some things must be sacrifised in order to get what I want, so before I commit my time to something, I need to ask myself whether this a good contribution, meaning it's adding value to my goals or subtracting it.
    Information gathering - Avoid learning everything at ones, try to keep up with that bootcamp's module to learn what matter, even though learning ahead sometimes is good, it can also lead me astray.

2. **Opportunities for Growth**:
    
    - Highlight any opportunities you can leverage for career growth.
    - Include networking, mentorship, or educational opportunities.
    Work - Because I am a barman, I meet a lot of diffrent people, it is not unlikely that I can meet someone who works in the tech world and would be willing to answer questions I have about being a developer.

    The internet - There are a lot of videos on youtube that highlight the everyday life of software developers, I can use those videos to learn their journey and the advice they tend to give their followers who unlike myslef, are brave enough to ask questions.

    AI - Many people are under the impression that AI is out to take every developer's job, I don't think so, I think if we are willing to levarage the power of AI we can become even better developers.
